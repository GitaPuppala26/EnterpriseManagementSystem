# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Installation

To create a project file with Vite and React, you can follow these steps:

1.Install Node.js: 
If you haven't already, you need to install Node.js on your system. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website: [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

2.Create a New Project Directory: 
Create a new directory where you want to set up your project.(FERP is my directory)

3.Open Terminal: 
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory you created.
                 
            cd Ferp

4.Initialize Project: 
Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
            npm create vite@latest 
            proceed to (y)
            give Project name:FinalEntManSys
            give Package name:finalentmansys
            Choose React from list
            Choose javascript from list 

5.Navigate to Project Directory: 
Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory:
    
    cd FinalEntManSys
   
6.Install Dependencies: 
Inside the project directory, install the project dependencies:
  
   npm install
   
7.Start Development Server: 
Finally, start the development server to run your React application:
   
   npm run dev
  
After running the `npm run dev` command, your React application should be up and running, and you can access it at `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.
